		The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AHH25E?ie=UTF8&tag=vacuumclean08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000AHH25E"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>Dirt Devil MBV2030</strong></a> was a compact, stylish looking vacuum back in the early 2000s. Released in 2007, it has been a little more than a decade since its release and was made up of both a broom and vacuum for easy use. Although outclassed by more advanced vacuums today, 15 years ago, this vacuum was not only portable but powerful as well, serving as memorabilia for engineers and vacuum enthusiasts today.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	When I used this vacuum years ago as a kid, I still remember how extremely easy it was to use considering it was just a light, portable, broom and vacuum. However, if for any reason you are unsure about any part of the vacuum, it does come with a <a href="https://www.manua.ls/dirt-devil/broom-vac-mbv2030/manual?p=2"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>manual</strong></a>. It had only one mode of cleaning so there wasn’t many cleaning modes compared to the several different modes that you would find in vacuums today. However, due it only having one mode of suction, to turn it on and off all you had to do was just press the power button and this made operating the vacuum and cleaning easy for all ages. The broom vac included replaceable brush heads, so it wasn’t a short-term use product which I liked. I also found it very easy to pick up debris with this vacuum without having to bend over.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	The battery life wasn’t too impressive as I only averaged around 4 to 5 hours of use. Compared to <a href="https://bestreviews.com/home/vacuums/best-dyson-vacuums?cid=198434321&aid=48220303428&eid=&tid=kwd-295629426226&ul=9004034&mt=e&n=g&d=c&dm=&dt&sn&adid=546662794250&k=dyson%20vacuum%20cleaner&p=&pc=&ap=&acid=1&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADo7KW9TDllK36yPB8r9c-pAtMoxK&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtJ6_BhDWARIsAGanmKcTQAupEUgf75fuGZYH05FcyGCI02REuvMbxMOSdIHnuQspVOJNsVQaAhUUEALw_wcB"target="_blank" class ="highlight"><strong>electric Dyson vacuums</strong></a>, the broom vac would not stand a chance. However, given this is battery powered was a huge plus since a lot of vacuums today are still powered by cords. Considering its battery run time, it would be best to fully charge it after every use and I found that if I was using it for a big cleanup, it would be efficient to pile up debris before suctioning. Like a traditional broom, the broom vac is only designed to be used on hard, flat surfaces, like a traditional broom. As a result, this did a poor job picking up dirt and debris when I tested it on the carpet. 
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	Maintaining the broom vac was extremely simple and straightforward. The <a href="https://chemistrytalk.org/what-is-vacuum-filtration/"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>filter</strong></a> would typically need to be cleaned once a month and left to dry for a day before use. The dirt cup in the broom vac would need to be regularly emptied, preferably after each cleaning cycle to ensure maximum performance. The <a href="https://vacutechllc.com/car-wash-vacuum-equipment/separators/"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>separator</strong></a> was also needed to be cleaned every time for optimal performance.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	After years of use, I found the broom vac to be a very efficient a lightweight machine. It’s great for quick clean ups on hard surfaces and is very easy and comfortable to hold. It’s compact structure, ease of use, and straightforward maintenance make it a great product for everyday use. Although it does not stand much of a chance against modern vacuums today. This product was nothing to look down upon 15 years ago. If you are someone looking for an old item that can get a boring chore done than you can count on the Dirt Devil MBV2030.

  <h1>A Good Place for Hidden Treasures from the Past</h1>

	<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/25+Main+St,+Somerville,+NJ+08876/''/@40.5682157,-74.6126738,19z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c3954b8711ea41:0xb56707e29d1c80a9!2m2!1d-74.6109188!2d40.5679152!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c3954ba303b0bd:0x13652f7d7f80264b!2m2!1d-74.612532!2d40.5682652?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>Elysium Antiques</strong></a> is a small, nice-looking shop that cater for people interested in past generations of items we use today. It may be smaller than its rival across the street in Somerville, NJ, but this is a great place to begin if you are looking for hidden treasures from earlier generations. When I walked in the store, I knew I could spend a day poking around in the shop as there is plenty to look at and items that could be of interest to anyone. I found the staff to be extremely nice and welcoming and I did not feel like I was being watched by the owners while browsing. So, it is safe to say that this is a comfortable shop to browse old memorabilia.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	I was impressed by the store's huge collection of merchandise. The store had a lot of kitchenware, typewriters, kettles, etc. Everything in the store was also organized by category, so it wasn’t difficult to find items. These old, stylish teacups and kettles had caught my eye as it reminded me of how people used to use these back in the day to drink tea and coffee. I also stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>typewriters</strong></a> which made me jump in joy as I am a huge fan of computers especially ones from the older generation. It was a great reminder of how technology had progressed so much since then. 
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	As I was roaming around, I encountered these <a href="https://www.antiquers.com/threads/antique-lamp-identification-worth.76989/"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>old lamps</strong></a> on the top shelf that looked extremely vintage. We usually use our phones today to check the time and it was fun to look back at how people used to use these huge, box shaped clocks instead. In a glass casing, I spotted these very old kitchen knives with beautifully carved handles. It made me quite sad as todays knives have plain, boring, dull handles with no design. What specifically grabbed my attention was a 1980s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricycle"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>tricycle</strong></a> sitting on the top shelf. It looked very small and rusty but was quite fascinating to look at. Compared to bikes today, it is clear that the tricycle was decades old. 
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	Although bottles have not changed much today, they had a distinct shape back then. As I noticed them in the store, I realized that back then, beverage bottles were a lot bigger and way more detailed. Usually, a Coke bottle will just have a plastic wrapper attached to it with the logo but back then, the logo was actually <a href="https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2023/01/27/package-deal-in-1915-coca-cola-had-many-imitators-then-it-designed-a-patented-bottle-nobody-could-copy"target="_blank" class = "highlight"><strong>engraved</strong></a> into the glass bottle itself. It seems with some companies, they have sacrificed design and quality over quantity as the years have gone by. 
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	Overall, visiting the Elysium Antique shop was a memorable experience. It is a fun place to visit if you want to catch a glimpse of what people used in the past. Although the store was small, they had a wide selection of antiques that were fairly priced. Even though the place looked really cluttered, all the items were efficiently categorized which made it easy to find specific items such as the typewriter for example.
