                <p class="visual-essay-text">
                    While direct examples of early mechanical vacuums might not be in my basement collection, the concept of using suction for cleaning has roots in the late 19th century. Devices utilizing bellows and hand-cranked fans attempted to draw dust and debris, offering an alternative to simply sweeping. These early contraptions, though cumbersome, represented the initial understanding of the power of airflow in cleaning. The "Broomvac" profile on our interactive map hints at this transitional period, bridging the gap between the broom and the powered vacuum.
