                <p class="visual-essay-text">
                    In the late 20th century, the advent of bagless vacuum technology, popularized by brands such as Dyson, revolutionized cleaning. The cyclonic separation system significantly improved suction efficiency by removing the need for disposable bags and preventing suction loss as dust accumulated. These vacuums featured clear dust containers, allowing users to see and easily empty collected debris. This not only reduced running costs but also enhanced the user experience, making cleaning maintenance simpler, quicker, and more hygienic.
